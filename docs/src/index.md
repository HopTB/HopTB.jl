# HopTB.jl

HopTB.jl is a tight binding package written in julia. The package has the ability of dealing with non-orthogonal tight binding models and aims at both first principle calculations of real materials and model calculations.

## Features

HopTB.jl is still under active development. Current features include
 - Anomalous Hall effect

 - Shift current conductivity
 - Second harmonic generation
 - General steady linear response
 - General steady Floquet linear response
 - Symmetrization of tight binding model
 - Construct symmetric Wannier functions
 - Intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity
 - Fermi surface extraction
